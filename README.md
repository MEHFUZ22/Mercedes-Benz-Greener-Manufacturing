      <h2 class="section-heading">Project Goal</h2>
    <p>
      The Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing project aims to reduce the time that Mercedes-Benz cars spend on the test bench. The project is driven by the need to optimize the testing system for various feature combinations, ensuring the safety and reliability of each unique car configuration. Given Mercedes-Benz's position as a leader in the premium car industry, the project recognizes the importance of maintaining high standards of safety and efficiency on the production lines.

      <h2>Problem Statement Scenario:</h2>
      <p>
        Since the first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886, Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive innovations. These include the passenger safety cell with a crumple zone, the airbag, and intelligent assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents per year, making the brand the European leader among premium carmakers. Mercedes-Benz is the leader in the premium car industry. With a huge selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized Mercedes-Benz of their dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure the safety and reliability of every unique car configuration before they hit the road, the company’s engineers have developed a robust testing system. As one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on Mercedes-Benz’s production lines. However, optimizing the speed of their testing system for many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are required to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. Others will work with a dataset representing different permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz car to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Mercedes-Benz’s standards.

      <h2>Following actions should be performed:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Remove variables with zero variance:</strong> If any column(s) in the dataset have zero variance, they are identified and removed. This step helps to eliminate unnecessary variables that do not contribute to the prediction process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Check for null and unique values:</strong> The dataset is carefully examined for any null or unique values in both the test and train sets. This ensures data integrity and enables the project team to address any inconsistencies or missing information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Apply label encoder:</strong> Categorical variables in the dataset are transformed into a numerical format using a label encoder. This encoding step is necessary for the algorithmic approach to work effectively with the data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Perform dimensionality reduction:</strong> To reduce the complexity of the dataset and improve computational efficiency, dimensionality reduction techniques are implemented. These techniques aim to retain the most important features while eliminating redundant or less impactful ones.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Predict test_df values using XGBoost:</strong> The XGBoost algorithm is employed to predict the values of the test dataset. XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its ability to handle complex relationships and make accurate predictions. By leveraging XGBoost, the project aims to achieve faster testing times and ultimately contribute to lower carbon dioxide emissions without compromising Mercedes-Benz's high standards.
